### 1. Project Justification

- **Why is your project needed?**
The project is essential due to the widespread issue of tax evasion, which impacts government revenues and resource allocation, hindering economic development and public service provision. By investigating the relationship between tax evasion and productivity, this study aims to shed light on potential policy gaps and opportunities for enhancing economic efficiency.

- **What problem will your project resolve?**
It addresses the lack of comprehensive understanding regarding how tax evasion affects productivity across different sectors and economies. This knowledge gap makes it challenging to design effective policies that can enhance compliance while supporting economic growth.

- **What are the project benefits?**
The benefits include providing policymakers with evidence-based insights to craft better regulations, potentially increasing tax compliance and public revenues, and offering strategies to improve productivity, thus contributing to a more equitable and efficient economic system.

### 2. Project Goals

- **Which products?**
The project will produce a comprehensive research thesis detailing the study's findings, policy recommendations, and a database of analyzed data regarding tax evasion and productivity metrics.

- **Which results?**
Expected outcomes include a better understanding of the mechanisms through which tax evasion impacts productivity, identification of sectors most affected by these dynamics, and evidence-based recommendations for policy improvements.

- **Which services or which capabilities to perform a service?**
The project aims to enhance the capability of policymakers and economic analysts to assess and address the impacts of tax evasion on productivity, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making processes.

### 3. Project Requirements
